## Notes and Takeaways
* Data structures are used to organize data which are more sequences or tables of values rather than a single value
An example of this is a list of numbers
* There are different types of data structures which are primitive and non-primitive
* Algorithms interact with data structures to create optimized code
* Imperative programming uses statements to change a program's states
* Objected Oriented Programming uses classes and objects to create objects and instances of them -> constructors, encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism

## Plans and requirements for Week 0
* Create an alternative menu in Java with a data structure and try and catch which is dynamic, rather than simply having switch statements that are hardcoded. This will likely use abstraction because subclasses are needed.
* Create a java class that can swap two numbers based on value. It prints the numbers first in the order given, then switches them and organizes them by value -> prints this out.
* Use 2D arrays in Jaca to print a formatted matrix; this has a toString method to format and output a String and properly accessing values in the 2D Array

# Test Prep

Something that will be crucial for me to do well on AP exams is participating well on the assignments assigned to us in class and focusing on understanding as much about Java code as it is possible for me because it will all come in handy later when I do take the exam


Also, I will begin to review each of the progress check multiple-choice (MC) that we did in the first trimester because they did a great job of testing us on relevant content that will be on the AP exam in the future. This will help me understand each of the unit's key concepts and have better preparation for the AP Exam. Furthermore, using the journal that we have from 1stt and 2nd trimester, we will be able to learn from previous mistakes. (looking at collegeboard).


Lastly, I will review all of the frqs we did last trimester and redo them so I can make sure I retained all of the knowledge I learned last trimester -> this will not only help me practice for the type of questions on the AP EXAM but also reinforce content I am not confident in
I will follow these steps each week and do it with my team members so we can hold each other accountable if we skip a day.

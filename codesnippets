**This week was a good wake-up call for me, as It was hard for me to get started with my code. Overall, I enjoyed working on making the blueprint class and understanding how the structure and formatting for a parent class works and how the extended classes take the properties of this abstract class and turn it into their own. I used this for the hashmap, as the parameters were the Blueprint class and a specified integer**

**This is where I initialized the hashmap and learned how to create a new data structure. Overall this is a cool way to organize your code and make sure that everything can be connected to other files. This is a very cool way to call code and because of the parameters, it makes it easy to call and is efficient. Takes way less time than making a case for each parameter and is fun! **
